+actionlint
+==========
+[![CI Badge][]][CI]
+[![API Document][api-badge]][apidoc]
 
-A new Flutter project.
+[actionlint][repo] is a static checker for GitHub Actions workflow files. [Try it online!][playground]
 
-## Getting Started
+Features:
 
-This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
+- **Syntax check for workflow files** to check unexpected or missing keys following [workflow syntax][syntax-doc]
+- **Strong type check for `${{ }}` expressions** to catch several semantic errors like access to not existing property,
+  type mismatches, ...
+- **Actions usage check** to check that inputs at `with:` and outputs in `steps.{id}.outputs` are correct
+- **Reusable workflow check** to check inputs/outputs/secrets of reusable workflows and workflow calls
+- **[shellcheck][] and [pyflakes][] integrations** for scripts at `run:`
+- **Security checks**; [script injection][script-injection-doc] by untrusted inputs, hard-coded credentials
+- **Other several useful checks**; [glob syntax][filter-pattern-doc] validation, dependencies check for `needs:`,
+  runner label validation, cron syntax validation, ...
 
-A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
+See [the full list](docs/checks.md) of checks done by actionlint.
 
-- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
-- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
+<img src="https://github.com/rhysd/ss/blob/master/actionlint/main.gif?raw=true" alt="actionlint reports 7 errors" width="806" height="492"/>
 
-For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
-[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
-samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
+**Example of broken workflow:**
+
+```yaml
+on:
+  push:
+    branch: main
+    tags:
+      - 'v\d+'
+jobs:
+  test:
+    strategy:
+      matrix:
+        os: [macos-latest, linux-latest]
+    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
+    steps:
+      - run: echo "Checking commit '${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}'"
+      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
+      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
+        with:
+          node_version: 18.x
+      - uses: actions/cache@v4
+        with:

+
+## Why?
+
+- **Running a workflow is time consuming.** You need to push the changes and wait until the workflow runs on GitHub even if
+  it contains some trivial mistakes. [act][] is useful to debug the workflow locally. But it is not suitable for CI and still
+  time consuming when your workflow gets larger.
+- **Checks of workflow files by GitHub are very loose.** It reports no error even if unexpected keys are in mappings
+  (meant that some typos in keys). And also it reports no error when accessing to property which is actually not existing.
+  For example `matrix.foo` when no `foo` is defined in `matrix:` section, it is evaluated to `null` and causes no error.
+- **Some mistakes silently break a workflow.** Most common case I saw is specifying missing property to cache key. In the
+  case cache silently does not work properly but a workflow itself runs without error. So you might not notice the mistake
+  forever.
+
+## Quick start
+
+Install `actionlint` command by downloading [the released binary][releases] or by Homebrew or by `go install`. See
+[the installation document](docs/install.md) for more details like how to manage the command with several package managers
+or run via Docker container.
+
+```sh
+go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest
+```
+
+Basically all you need to do is run the `actionlint` command in your repository. actionlint automatically detects workflows and
+checks errors. actionlint focuses on finding out mistakes. It tries to catch errors as much as possible and make false positives
+as minimal as possible.
+
+```sh
+actionlint
+```
+
+Another option to try actionlint is [the online playground][playground]. Your browser can run actionlint through WebAssembly.
+
+See [the usage document](docs/usage.md) for more details.

+Go API
+======
+[![API Document][api-badge]][apidoc]
+
+This document describes how to use [actionlint](..) as Go library.
+
+actionlint can be used from Go programs. See [the documentation][apidoc] to know the list of all APIs. It contains
+a workflow file parser built on top of `go-yaml/yaml`, expression `${{ }}` lexer/parser/checker, etc.
+
+Followings are unexhaustive list of interesting APIs.
+
+- `Command` struct represents entire `actionlint` command. `Command.Main` takes command line arguments and runs command
+  until the end and returns exit status.
+- `Linter` manages linter lifecycle and applies checks to given files. If you want to run actionlint checks in your
+  program, please use this struct.
+- `Project` and `Projects` detect a project (Git repository) in a given directory path and find configuration in it.
+- `Config` represents structure of `actionlint.yaml` config file. It can be decoded by [go-yaml/yaml][go-yaml] library.
+- `Workflow`, `Job`, `Step`, ... are nodes of workflow syntax tree. `Workflow` is a root node.
+- `Parse()` parses given contents into a workflow syntax tree. It tries to find syntax errors as much as possible and
+  returns found errors as slice.
+- `Pass` is a visitor to traverse a workflow syntax tree. Multiple passes can be applied at single pass using `Visitor`.
+- `Rule` is an interface for rule checkers and `RuneBase` is a base struct to implement a rule checker.
+  - `RuleExpression` is a rule checker to check expression syntax in `${{ }}`.
+  - `RuleShellcheck` is a rule checker to apply `shellcheck` command to `run:` sections and collect errors from it.
+  - `RuleJobNeeds` is a rule checker to check dependencies in `needs:` section. It can detect cyclic dependencies.
+  - ...
+- `ExprLexer` lexes expression syntax in `${{ }}` and returns slice of `Token`.
+- `ExprParser` parses given slice of `Token` and returns syntax tree for expression in `${{ }}`. `ExprNode` is an
+  interface for nodes in the expression syntax tree.
+- `ExprType` is an interface of types in expression syntax `${{ }}`. `ObjectType`, `ArrayType`, `StringType`,
+  `NumberType`, ... are structs to represent actual types of expression.
+- `ExprSemanticsChecker` checks semantics of expression syntax `${{ }}`. It traverses given expression syntax tree and
+  deduces its type, checking types and resolving variables (contexts).
+- `ValidateRefGlob()` and `ValidatePathGlob()` validate [glob filter pattern][filter-pattern-doc] and returns all errors
+  found by the validator.
+- `ActionMetadata` is a struct for action metadata file (`action.yml`). It is used to check inputs specified at `with:`
+  and typing `steps.{id}.outputs` object strictly.
+- `PopularActions` global variable is the data set of popular actions' metadata collected by [the script](../scripts/generate-popular-actions).
+- `AllWebhookTypes` global variable is the mapping from all webhook names to their types collected by [the script](../scripts/generate-webhook-events).
+- `WorkflowKeyAvailability()` returns available context names and special function names for the given workflow key like
+  `jobs.<job_id>.outputs.<output_id>`. This function uses the data collected by [the script](../scripts/generate-availability).
+
+## Library versioning
+
+The version of this repository is for command line tool `actionlint`. So it does not represent the version of the library.
+It means that the library does not follow semantic versioning and any patch version bump may introduce some breaking changes.
+
+## Go version compatibility
+
+Minimum supported Go version is written in [`go.mod`](../go.mod) file in this repository. That said, older Go versions are
+actually not tested on CI. Last two major Go versions are recommended because they're tested on CI. For example, when the latest
+Go version is v1.22, v1.21 and v1.22 are nice to use.

+<a name="check-unexpected-keys"></a>
+## Unexpected keys
+
+Example input:
+
+```yaml
+on: push
+jobs:
+  test:
+    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+    # ERROR: Typo of `defaults:`
+    default:
+      run:
+        working-directory: /path/to/dir
+    steps:
+      - run: echo hello
+        # ERROR: `shell:` must be in lower case
+        Shell: bash
+```
+
+Output:
+
+```
+test.yaml:6:5: unexpected key "default" for "job" section. expected one of "concurrency", "container", "continue-on-error", "defaults", "env", "environment", "if", "name", "needs", "outputs", "permissions", "runs-on", "secrets", "services", "steps", "strategy", "timeout-minutes", "uses", "with" [syntax-check]
+  |
+6 |     default:
+  |     ^~~~~~~~
+test.yaml:12:9: unexpected key "Shell" for "step" section. expected one of "continue-on-error", "env", "id", "if", "name", "run", "shell", "timeout-minutes", "uses", "with", "working-directory" [syntax-check]
+   |
+12 |         Shell: bash
+   |         ^~~~~~
+```
+
+[Playground](https://rhysd.github.io/actionlint#eJw9jEEOwyAMBO95xX4AcecbfQEkTkmLMMK2ov6+ATU92d6ZNdeAZpKXFycJC6AkOibQrYrji1uyquZKHGyijfZo5edN816Bk/v7qE+3HZ1W5f4J8C1q9sr+yqYnSk3uipt90JoZmUrh/6vHOANSlPwFtPsxjA==)
+
+[Workflow syntax][syntax-doc] defines what keys can be defined in which mapping object. When unknown key is defined, it makes
+the workflow run fail.
+
+actionlint can detect unexpected keys while parsing workflow syntax and report them as an error.
+
+Key names are basically case sensitive (though some specific key names are case insensitive). This check is useful to catch
+case-sensitivity mistakes.
+
+<a name="check-missing-required-duplicate-keys"></a>
+## Missing required keys and key duplicates
+
+Example input:
+
+```yaml
+on: push
+jobs:
+  test:
+    strategy:
+      # ERROR: Matrix name is duplicated. These keys are case insensitive
+      matrix:
+        version_name: [v1, v2]
+        VERSION_NAME: [V1, V2]
+    # ERROR: runs-on is missing
+    steps:
+      - run: echo 'hello'
+```
+
+Output:
+
+```
+test.yaml:3:3: "runs-on" section is missing in job "test" [syntax-check]
+  |
+3 |   test:
+  |   ^~~~~
+test.yaml:8:9: key "version_name" is duplicated in "matrix" section. previously defined at line:7,col:9. note that key names are case insensitive [syntax-check]
+  |
+8 |         VERSION_NAME: [V1, V2]
+  |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
+```
+
+[Playground](https://rhysd.github.io/actionlint#eJzLz7NSKCgtzuDKyk8qtuJSUChJLS4B0QoKxSVFiSWp6ZUQnoJCbmJJUWYFjKegUJZaVJyZnxefl5ibaqUQXWaoo1BmFAuXDnMNCvb094v3c/R1BUqHAaXDoNLFJakFxTCDdBWKSoGOSE3OyFdQz0jNyclXBwA2byiy)
+
+Some mappings must include specific keys. For example, job mappings must include `runs-on:` and `steps:`.
+
+And duplicate keys are not allowed. In workflow syntax, comparing some keys is **case insensitive**. For example, the job ID
+`test` in lower case and the job ID `TEST` in upper case are not able to exist in the same workflow.
+
+actionlint checks these missing required keys and duplicate keys while parsing, and reports an error.

+## Type checks for expression syntax in `${{ }}`
+
+actionlint checks types of expressions in `${{ }}` placeholders of templates. The following types are supported by the type
+checker.
+
+| Type          | Description                                                                                | Notation                 |
+|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
+| Any           | Any value like `any` type in TypeScript. Fallback type when a value can no longer be typed | `any`                    |
+| Number        | Number value (integer or float)                                                            | `number`                 |

+Type check by actionlint is more strict than GitHub Actions runtime.

+
+Type checks for expression syntax in `${{ }}` are done by semantics checker. Note that actual type checks by GitHub Actions
+runtime is loose.
+
+Any object value can be assigned into string value as string `'Object'`. `echo '${{ env }}'` will be replaced with
+`echo 'Object'`. And an array can also be converted into `'Array'` string. Such loose conversions are bugs in almost all cases.
+actionlint checks types more strictly. actionlint checks values evaluated at `${{ }}` are not object (replaced with string
+`'Object'`), array (replaced with string `'Array'`), nor null (replaced with string `''`). If you want to check a content of
+object or array, use `toJSON()` function.
+
+```
+echo '${{ toJSON(github.event) }}'
+```
+
+There are two object types internally. One is an object which is strict for properties, which causes a type error when trying to
+access unknown properties. And another is an object which is not strict for properties, which allows to access unknown properties.
+In the case, accessing unknown property is typed as `any`.
+
+When the type check cannot be done statically, the type is deduced to `any` (e.g. return type of `toJSON()`).
+
+As special case of `${{ }}`, it can be used for expanding object and array values.

+
+```yaml

+[Contexts][contexts-doc] and [built-in functions][funcs-doc] are strongly typed. Typos in property access of contexts and
+function names can be checked. And invalid function calls like wrong number of arguments or type mismatch at parameter also
+can be checked thanks to type checker.
+
+The semantics checker can properly handle that
+
+- some functions are overloaded (e.g. `contains(str, substr)` and `contains(array, item)`)
+- some parameters are optional (e.g. `join(strings, sep)` and `join(strings)`)
+- some parameters are repeatable (e.g. `hashFiles(file1, file2, ...)`)
+
+In addition, `format()` function has a special check for placeholders in the first parameter which represents the formatting
+string.
+
+Note that context names and function names are case insensitive. For example, `toJSON` and `toJson` are the same function.

+Outputs of step can be accessed via `steps.<step_id>` objects. The `steps` context is dynamic:
+
+- Accessing the outputs before running the step causes `null`
+- Outputs of steps only in the job can be accessed. It cannot access steps across jobs
+
+It is a common mistake to access the wrong step outputs since people often forget to fix placeholders on copying&pasting
+steps. actionlint can catch invalid accesses to step outputs and reports them as errors.
+
+When the outputs are set by popular actions, the outputs object is more strictly typed.

+
+In the above example, [actions/cache][actions-cache] action sets `cache-hit` output so that the following steps can know
+whether the cache was hit or not. At line 8, the cache action is not run yet. So `cache` property does not exist in the
+`steps` context yet. On running the step whose ID is `cache`, `steps.cache` object is typed as
+`{outputs: {cache-hit: any}, conclusion: string, outcome: string}`. At line 18, the expression has a typo in the output
+name. actionlint can check it because properties of `steps.cache.outputs` are typed.
+
+This strict typing for outputs is also applied to local actions. Let's say we have the following local action.

+
+Expressions in `${{ }}` placeholders support `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` comparison operators. Arbitrary types of operands
+can be compared. When different type values are compared, they are implicitly converted to numbers before the comparison. Please
+see [the official document][operators-doc] to know the details of operators behavior.
+
+However, comparisons between some types are actually meaningless:
+
+- Objects and arrays are converted to `NaN`. Comparing an object or an array with other type is always evaluated to false.
+- Comparing booleans, null, objects, and arrays with `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` makes no sense.
+
+actionlint checks operands of comparison operators and reports errors in these cases.
+
+There are some additional surprising behaviors, but actioonlint allows them not to cause false positives as much as possible.
+
+- `0 == null`, `'0' == null`, `false == null` are true since they are implicitly converted to `0 == 0`
+- `'0' == false` and `0 == false` are true due to the same reason as above
+- Objects and arrays are only considered equal when they are the same instance

+
+[shellcheck][] is a famous linter for ShellScript. actionlint runs shellcheck for scripts at `run:` step in a workflow.
+For installing shellcheck, see [the official installation document][shellcheck-install].
+
+actionlint detects which shell is used to run the scripts following [the documentation][shell-doc]. On Linux or macOS the
+default shell is `bash`, and on Windows it is `pwsh`. Shell can be configured by `shell:` configuration at a workflow
+level or job level. Each step can configure shell to run scripts by `shell:`.
+
+In the above example output, `SC2086:info:1:6:` means that shellcheck reported SC2086 rule violation and the location is at
+line 1, column 6. Note that the location is relative to the script of the `run:` section.
+
+actionlint remembers the default shell and checks what OS the job runs on. Only when the shell is `bash` or `sh`, actionlint
+applies shellcheck to scripts.
+
+By default, actionlint checks if `shellcheck` command exists in your system and uses it when it is found. The `-shellcheck`
+option on running `actionlint` command specifies the executable path of shellcheck. Setting empty string by `shellcheck=`
+disables shellcheck integration explicitly.
+
+Since both `${{ }}` expression syntax and ShellScript's variable access `$FOO` use `$`, the remaining `${{ }}` confuses
+shellcheck. To avoid it, actionlint replaces `${{ }}` with underscores. For example `echo '${{ matrix.os }}'` is replaced
+with `echo '________________'`.
+
+Some shellcheck rules conflict with the `${{ }}` expression syntax. To avoid errors due to the syntax, [SC1091][], [SC2050][],
+[SC2194][], [SC2154][], [SC2157][] are disabled.
+
+When what shell is used cannot be determined statically, actionlint assumes `shell: bash` optimistically. For example,
+
+```yaml
+strategy:
+  matrix:
+    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
+runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
+steps:
+  - name: Show file content
+    run: Get-Content -Path xxx\yyy.txt
+    if: ${{ matrix.os == 'windows-latest' }}
+```
+
+The 'Show file content' script is only run by `pwsh` due to `matrix.os == 'windows-latest'` guard. However actionlint does not
+know that. It checks the script with shellcheck and it'd probably cause a false-positive (due to file separator). This kind of
+false positives can be avoided by showing the shell name explicitly. It is also better in terms of maintenance of the workflow.
+
+```yaml
+- name: Show file content
+  run: Get-Content -Path xxx\yyy.txt
+  if: ${{ matrix.os == 'windows-latest' }}
+  shell: pwsh
+```
+
+When you want to control shellcheck behavior, [`SHELLCHECK_OPTS` environment variable][shellcheck-env-var] is useful.
+
+From command line:
+
+```sh
+# Enable some optional rules
+SHELLCHECK_OPTS='--enable=avoid-nullary-conditions' actionlint
+
+# Disable some rules
+SHELLCHECK_OPTS='--exclude=SC2129' actionlint
+```
+
+On GitHub Actions:
+
+```yaml
+- run: actionlint
+  env:
+    SHELLCHECK_OPTS: --exclude=SC2129

+
+Python script can be written in `run:` when `shell: python` is configured.
+
+[pyflakes][] is a famous linter for Python. It is suitable for linting small code like scripts at `run:` since it focuses
+on finding mistakes (not a code style issue) and tries to make false positives as minimal as possible. Install pyflakes
+by `pip install pyflakes`.
+
+actionlint runs pyflakes for scripts at `run:` steps in a workflow and reports errors found by pyflakes. actionlint detects
+Python scripts in a workflow by checking `shell: python` at each step and `defaults:` configurations at workflows and jobs.
+
+By default, actionlint checks if `pyflakes` command exists in your system and uses it when found. The `-pyflakes` option
+of `actionlint` command allows to specify the executable path of pyflakes. Setting empty string by `pyflakes=` disables
+pyflakes integration explicitly.
+
+Since both `${{ }}` expression syntax is invalid as Python, remaining `${{ }}` might confuse pyflakes. To avoid it,
+actionlint replaces `${{ }}` with underscores. For example `print('${{ matrix.os }}')` is replaced with
+`print('________________')`.

+
+Since `${{ }}` placeholders are evaluated and replaced directly by GitHub Actions runtime, you need to use them carefully in
+inline scripts at `run:`. For example, if we have step as follows,
+
+```yaml
+- run: echo 'issue ${{github.event.issue.title}}'
+```
+
+an attacker can create a new issue with the title `'; malicious_command ...`, and the inline script will run
+`echo 'issue'; malicious_command ...` in your workflow. The remediation of such script injection is passing potentially untrusted
+inputs via environment variables. See [the official document][security-doc] for more details.
+
+```yaml
+- run: echo "issue ${TITLE}"
+  env:
+    TITLE: ${{github.event.issue.title}}
+```
+
+actionlint recognizes the following inputs as potentially untrusted and checks your inline scripts at `run:`. When they are used
+directly in a script, actionlint will report it as an error.
+
+- `github.event.issue.title`
+- `github.event.issue.body`
+- `github.event.pull_request.title`
+- `github.event.pull_request.body`
+- `github.event.comment.body`
+- `github.event.review.body`
+- `github.event.review_comment.body`
+- `github.event.pages.*.page_name`
+- `github.event.commits.*.message`
+- `github.event.head_commit.message`

+- `github.head_ref`
+
+Not only direct access to the untrusted properties, actionlint also detects those properties indirectly accessed via
+[object filter syntax][object-filter-syntax]. For example, `github.event.*.body` collects all `body` properties in child objects
+of `github.event` as array. Those properties include untrusted inputs like `github.event.comment.body`,
+`github.event.pull_request.body`, ...

+
+[`workflow_dispatch`][workflow-dispatch-event] is an event to trigger a workflow manually. The event can have parameters called
+'inputs'. Each input has its name, description, default value, and [input type][workflow-dispatch-input-type-announce].
+
+actionlint checks several mistakes around `workflow_dispatch` configuration.
+
+- Input type must be one of 'choice', 'string', 'number', 'boolean', 'environment'
+- `options:` must be set for 'choice' input type
+- The default value of 'choice' input must be included in options
+- The default value of 'boolean' input must be `true` or `false`
+- The default value of 'number' input must be parsed as a float number
+
+In addition, `github.event.inputs` and `inputs` objects are typed based on the input definitions. Properties not defined in
+`inputs:` will cause a type error thanks to a type checker.
+
+For example,
+
+```yaml
+inputs:
+  string_input:
+    type: string
+  choice_input:
+    type: choice
+    options: ['hello']
+  bool_input:
+    type: boolean
+  num_input:
+    type: number
+  env_input:
+    type: environment
+  no_type_input:
+```
+
+`inputs` is typed as follows from these definitions:
+
+```
+{
+  "string_input": string;
+  "choice_input": string;
+  "bool_input": bool;
+  "num_input": number;
+  "env_input": string;
+  "no_type_input": any;
+}
+```
+
+`github.event.inputs` is typed as follows since all properties of it are strings unlike `inputs`:
+
+```
+{
+  "string_input": string;
+  "choice_input": string;
+  "bool_input": string;
+  "num_input": string;
+  "env_input": string;
+  "no_type_input": string;
+}

+
+For filtering branches, tags and paths in Webhook events, [glob syntax][filter-pattern-doc] is available.
+actionlint validates glob patterns `branches:`, `branches-ignore:`, `tags:`, `tags-ignore:`, `paths:`, `paths-ignore:` in a
+workflow. It checks:
+
+- syntax errors like missing closing brackets for character range `[..]`
+- invalid usage like `?` following `*`, invalid character range `[9-1]`, ...
+- invalid character usage for Git ref names (branch name, tag name)
+  - ref name cannot start/end with `/`
+  - ref name cannot contain `[`, `:`, `\`, ...
+
+Most common mistake I have ever seen here is a misunderstanding that regular expression is available for filtering.
+This rule can catch the mistake so that users can notice their mistakes.

+`runs-on: ${{ matrix.foo }}`, actionlint parses the expression and resolves the possible values, then validates the values.
+
+When you define some custom labels for your self-hosted runner, actionlint does not know the labels. Please set the label
+names in [`actionlint.yaml` configuration file](config.md) to let actionlint know them.
+
+In addition to checking label values, actionlint checks combinations of labels. `runs-on:` section can be an array that contains
+multiple labels. In this case, a runner which has all the labels will be selected. However, those labels combinations can have
+conflicts.
+
+Example input:
+
+```yaml
+on: push
+jobs:
+  test:
+    runs-on: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
+    steps:
+      - run: echo ...
+```
+
+Output:
+
+```
+test.yaml:4:30: label "windows-latest" conflicts with label "ubuntu-latest" defined at line:4,col:15. note: to run your job on each worker, use matrix [runner-label]
+  |
+4 |     runs-on: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
+  |                              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+
+In most cases, this is a misunderstanding that a matrix combination can be specified at `runs-on:` directly. It should use
+`matrix:` and expand it with `${{ }}` at `runs-on:` to run the workflow on multiple runners.

+Action needs to be specified in a format defined in [the document][action-uses-doc]. There are 3 types of actions:
+
+- action hosted on GitHub: `owner/repo/path@ref`
+- local action: `./path/to/my-action`
+- Docker action: `docker://image:tag`
+
+actionlint checks values at `uses:` sections follow one of these formats.
+
+Note that actionlint does not report any error when a directory for a local action does not exist in the repository because it is
+a common case where the action is managed in a separate repository and the action directory is cloned at running the workflow.
+(See [#25][issue-25] and [#40][issue-40] for more details).

+
+actionlint checks inputs of many popular actions such as `actions/checkout@v3`. It checks
+
+- some input is required by the action but it is not set at `with:`
+- input set at `with:` is not defined in the action (this commonly occurs by a typo)
+
+this is done by checking `with:` section items with a small database collected at building `actionlint` binary. actionlint
+can check popular actions without fetching any `action.yml` of the actions from the remote so that it can run efficiently.
+
+Note that it only supports the case of specifying major versions like `actions/checkout@v3`. Fixing version of action like
+`actions/checkout@v3.0.2` and using the HEAD of action like `actions/checkout@main` are not supported for now.
+
+So far, actionlint supports more than 100 popular actions The data set is embedded at [`popular_actions.go`](../popular_actions.go)
+and were automatically collected by [a script][generate-popular-actions]. If you want more checks for other actions, please
+make a request [as an issue][issue-form].

+
+In addition to the checks for inputs of actions described in [the previous section](#check-popular-action-inputs), actionlint
+reports an error when a popular action is 'outdated'. An action is outdated when the runner used by the action is no longer
+supported by GitHub Actions runtime. For example, `node12` is no longer available so any actions can use `node12` runner.
+
+Note that this check doesn't report that the action version is up-to-date. For example, even if you use `actions/checkout@v3` and
+newer version `actions/checkout@v4` is available, actionlint reports no error as long as `actions/checkout@v3` is not outdated.
+If you want to keep actions used by your workflows up-to-date, consider to use [Dependabot][dependabot-doc].

+## Reusable workflows
+
+[Reusable workflows][reusable-workflow-doc] is a feature to call a workflow from another workflow.
+
+actionlint does several checks for both workflow calls (caller) and reusable workflows (callee):
+
+- syntax of workflow calls and reusable workflows
+- type checks for inputs (respecting `type:` field of each input) in both workflow calls and reusable workflows
+- type checks for `inputs`, `outputs` and `secrets` context objects in reusable workflows
+- optional/required/undefined inputs and secrets at `uses:` in workflow calls
+- type checks for `outputs` objects used by downstream jobs of workflow calls
+
+These checks are described in this section.
+

+
+When calling an external workflow, [only specific keys are available][reusable-workflow-call-keys] at job configuration.
+For example, `secrets:` is not available when running steps in a normal job. And `runs-on:` is not available when calling
+a reusable workflow since the called workflow determines which OS is used. actionlint checks such keys are used correctly
+to call a reusable workflow or to run steps in a normal job.
+
+And the workflow syntax at `uses:` must follow the format `owner/repo/path/to/workflow.yml@ref` as described in
+[the official document][create-reusable-workflow-doc]. actionlint checks if the value follows the format.
+
+actionlint also validates the called workflow file is actually existing when it is a local workflow (starting with `./`).
+actionlint reports an error when it does not exist.

+
+Inputs of reusable workflow calls are set to `inputs.*` properties following the definitions at `on.workflow_call.inputs`.
+And in a job of a reusable workflow, `secrets.*` are passed from caller of the workflow so it is set following the definitions at
+`on.workflow_call.secrets`. See [the official document][create-reusable-workflow-doc] for more details.
+
+actionlint contextually defines types of `inputs` and `secrets` contexts looking at `workflow_call` event. Keys of `inputs` only
+allow keys at `on.workflow_call.inputs` and their values are typed based on `on.workflow_call.inputs.<input_name>.type`. Type of
+`secrets` is also strictly typed following `on.workflow_call.secrets`.
+
+[From May 3, 2022][inherit-secrets-announce], GitHub Actions allows inheriting secrets by calling reusable workflows. The caller
+declares to inherit all secrets.
+
+```yaml
+jobs:
+  pass-secrets-to-workflow:
+    uses: ./.github/workflows/called-workflow.yml
+    secrets: inherit
+```
+
+This means that actionlint cannot know whether the workflow inherits secrets or not when checking a reusable workflow.
+To solve this issue, actionlint assumes that
+
+- when `secrets:` is omitted in a reusable workflow, the workflow inherits secrets from a caller
+- when `secrets:` exists in a reusable workflow, the workflow inherits no other secret
+
+Following the assumptions,
+
+```yaml
+on:
+  workflow_call:
+
+jobs:
+  pass-secret-to-action:
+    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+    steps:
+      # OK: This reports no error. FOO is assumed to be inherited from caller
+      - run: echo ${{ secrets.FOO }}
+```
+
+this workflow causes no error. And
+
+```yaml
+on:
+  workflow_call:
+    secrets:
+
+jobs:
+  pass-secret-to-action:
+    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+    steps:
+      # ERROR: Secret FOO is not defined
+      - run: echo ${{ secrets.FOO }}

+
+this workflow causes 'no such secret' error at `secrets.FOO`.

+Outputs of a reusable workflow can be defined at `on.workflow_call.outputs` as described in [the document][reusable-workflow-outputs].
+The `jobs` context is available to define an output value to refer the outputs of jobs in the workflow. actionlint checks
+the context is used correctly.
+
+### Check inputs and secrets in workflow call
+
+Example reusable workflow:
+
+```yaml
+# .github/workflows/reusable.yaml
+on:
+  workflow_call:
+    inputs:

+```
+
+Reusable workflows can define required/optional inputs and secrets. When they are missing or some undefined input is used in a
+workflow call, actionlint reports an error.
+
+And reusable workflows must define types of their inputs by `type:` field. Workflow calls pass constants (`input: 42`) or
+expressions (`inputs: ${{ ... }}`) to the inputs or secrets. actionlint checks types of values passed to inputs in workflow call.
+When a type of input doesn't match to its definition, actionlint reports an error.
+
+Note that this check only works with local reusable workflow (it starts with `./`).
+
+### Check outputs of workflow call in downstream jobs
+
+Example reusable workflow:
+
+```yaml
+# .github/workflows/get-build-info.yaml
+on:
+  workflow_call:
+    outputs:
+      version:
+        value: ${{ outputs.version }}
+        description: version of software
+
+jobs:
+  test:
+    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+    outputs:
+      version: ${{ steps.get_version.outputs.version }}
+    steps:
+      - run: ...
+        id: get_version
+```
+
+Example input:
+
+```yaml
+on: push
+
+jobs:
+  get_build_info:
+    uses: ./.github/workflows/get-build-info.yaml
+  downstream:
+    needs: [get_build_info]
+    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+    steps:
+      # OK. `version` is defined in the reusable workflow
+      - run: echo '${{ needs.get_build_info.outputs.version }}'
+      # ERROR: `tag` is not defined in the reusable workflow
+      - run: echo '${{ needs.get_build_info.outputs.tag }}'
+```
+
+Output:
+
+```
+test.yaml:13:24: property "tag" is not defined in object type {version: string} [expression]
+   |
+13 |       - run: echo '${{ needs.get_build_info.outputs.tag }}'
+   |                        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+```
+
+Outputs of workflow call are set to the job's outputs object. They can be accessed by downstream jobs specified with `needs:`.
+What outputs are set is defined in the reusable workflow. actionlint types outputs objects from workflow calls and check the
+object types in downstream jobs.
+
+In the above example, `get-build-info.yaml` has one output `version`. actionlint types the outputs object of workflow call job
+as `{version: string}`. In the downstream job, actionlint can report an error at undefined key `tag` in the object.
+
+Note that this check only works with local reusable workflow (starting with `./`).

+
+Evaluation of `${{ }}` at `if:` condition is tricky. When the expression in `${{ }}` is evaluated to boolean value and there is
+no extra characters around the `${{ }}`, the condition is evaluated to the boolean value. Otherwise the condition is treated as
+string hence it is **always** evaluated to `true`.
+
+It means that multi-line string must not be used at `if:` condition (`if: |`) because the condition is always evaluated to true.
+Multi-line string inserts newline character at end of each line.
+
+```yaml
+if: |
+  ${{ false }}
+```
+
+is equivalent to
+
+```yaml
+if: "${{ false }}\n"
+```
+
+Unlike using `${{ }}`, putting an expression directly ignores white spaces around it. It's the reason why
+
+```yaml
+if: |
+  false
+```
+
+works as intended.
+
+actionlint checks all `if:` conditions in workflow and reports error when some condition is always evaluated to true due to extra
+characters around `${{ }}`.

+## Action metadata syntax validation
+
+Example workflow input:
+
+```yaml
+on: push
+
+jobs:
+  test:

+    steps:
+      # actionlint checks an action when it is actually used in a workflow
+      - uses: ./.github/actions/my-invalid-action
+```
+
+Example action metadata:
+
+```yaml
+# .github/actions/my-invalid-action/action.yml
+
+name: 'My action'
+author: '...'
+# ERROR: 'description' section is required
+

+
+All actions require a metadata file `action.yml` or `aciton.yaml`. The syntax is defined in [the official document][action-metadata-doc].
+
+actionlint checks metadata files used in workflows and reports errors when they are not following the syntax.
+
+- `name:`, `description:`, `runs:` sections are required
+- Runner name at `using:` is one of `composite`, `docker`, `node16`, `node20`
+- Keys under `runs:` section are correct. Required/Valid keys are different depending on the type of action; Docker action or
+  Composite action or JavaScript action (e.g. `image:` is required for Docker action).
+- Files specified in some keys under `runs` are existing. For example, JavaScript action defines a script file path for
+  entrypoint at `main:`.
+- Icon name at `icon:` in `branding:` section is correct. Supported icon names are listed in
+  [the official document][branding-icons-doc].
+- Icon color at `color:` in `branding:` section is correct. Supported icon colors are white, yellow, blue, green, orange, red,
+  purple, or gray-dark.
+
+actionlint checks action metadata files which are used by workflows. Currently it is not supported to specify `action.yml`
+directly via command line arguments.
+
+Note that `steps` in Composite action's metadata is not checked at this point. It will be supported in the future.

+Configuration
+=============
+
+This document describes how to configure [actionlint](..) behavior.
+
+Note that configuration file is optional. The author tries to keep configuration file as minimal as possible not to
+bother users to configure behavior of actionlint. Running actionlint without configuration file would work fine in most
+cases.
+
+## Configuration file
+
+Configuration file `actionlint.yaml` or `actionlint.yml` can be put in `.github` directory.
+
+Note: If you're using [Super-Linter][], the file should be placed in a different directory. Please check the project's document.
+
+You don't need to write the first configuration file by your hand. `actionlint` command can generate a default configuration
+with `-init-config` flag.
+
+```sh
+actionlint -init-config
+vim .github/actionlint.yaml
+```
+
+Currently only one item can be configured.
+
+```yaml
+self-hosted-runner:
+  # Labels of self-hosted runner in array of string
+  labels:
+    - linux.2xlarge
+    - windows-latest-xl
+    - linux-multi-gpu
+# Configuration variables in array of strings defined in your repository or organization
+config-variables:
+  - DEFAULT_RUNNER
+  - JOB_NAME
+  - ENVIRONMENT_STAGE
+```
+
+- `self-hosted-runner`: Configuration for your self-hosted runner environment.
+  - `labels`: Label names added to your self-hosted runners as list of pattern. Glob syntax supported by [`path.Match`][pat]
+    is available.
+- `config-variables`: [Configuration variables][vars]. When an array is set, actionlint will check `vars` properties strictly.
+  An empty array means no variable is allowed. The default value `null` disables the check.

+
+## Linux
+
+### [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)
+
+[`actionlint` package][archlinux] is available in the official repo:
+
+```sh
+pacman -S actionlint
+```
+
+Alternatively actionlint is also available on [AUR][aur]. The packages can be installed via [`paru`][paru] command.
+
+- [actionlint-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/actionlint-bin)
+- [actionlint-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/actionlint-git)
+
+### [Nix](https://nixos.wiki/)
+
+[`actionlint` package][nixpkgs] is available in the Nix ecosystem:
+
+On NixOS:
+
+```sh
+nix-env -iA nixos.actionlint
+```
+
+On Non NixOS:
+
+```sh
+nix-env -iA nixpkgs.actionlint
+```
+
+## macOS
+
+### [Homebrew][homebrew]
+
+[`actionlint`][formula] formula is provided by Homebrew officially.
+
+```sh
+brew install actionlint
+```
+
+Alternatively rhysd/actionlint repository also provides its own Homebrew package, which is automatically updated on new release.
+If you prefer it, tap the repository before running `brew install`.
+
+```sh
+brew tap "rhysd/actionlint" "https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint"
+brew install actionlint
+```
+
+## Prebuilt binaries
+
+Download an archive file from [the releases page][releases] for your platform, unarchive it and put the executable file to a
+directory in `$PATH`.
+
+Prebuilt binaries are built at each release by CI for the following OS and arch:
+
+- macOS (x86_64, arm64)
+- Linux (i386, x86_64, arm32, arm64)
+- Windows (i386, x86_64, arm64)
+- FreeBSD (i386, x86_64)
+
+Note: The following targets are not tested since GitHub Actions doesn't support them:
+
+- Linux i386, arm32, arm64
+- Windows i386, arm64
+- FreeBSD i386, x86_64
+
+<a name="download-script"></a>
+## Download script
+
+To install `actionlint` executable with one command, [the download script](../scripts/download-actionlint.bash) is available.
+It downloads the latest version of actionlint (`actionlint.exe` on Windows and `actionlint` on other OSes) to the current
+directory automatically. This is a recommended way if you install actionlint in some shell script.
+
+```sh
+bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/actionlint/main/scripts/download-actionlint.bash)
+```
+
+When you need to install specific version of actionlint, please give the version to the 1st command line argument. The following
+example installs v1.6.17.
+
+```sh
+bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/actionlint/main/scripts/download-actionlint.bash) 1.6.17
+```
+
+This script downloads `actionlint` (or `actionlint.exe` on Windows) binary to the current working directory. When you need to put
+the downloaded binary to some other directory, please give the directory path to the 2nd command line argument. The following
+example installs the latest version to `/usr/bin`.
+
+```sh
+bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/actionlint/main/scripts/download-actionlint.bash) latest /usr/bin
+```
+
+For the usage of actionlint on GitHub Actions, see [the usage document](usage.md#on-github-actions).
+
+## Docker image
+
+See [the usage document](./usage.md#docker) to know how to install and use an official actionlint Docker image.
+
+## asdf
+
+You can install actionlint with the [asdf version manager][asdf] using the [asdf-actionlint][asdf-plugin] plugin, which
+automates the process of installing (and switching between) various versions of GitHub release binaries. With asdf already
+installed, run these commands to install actionlint:
+
+```bash
+# Add actionlint plugin
+asdf plugin add actionlint
+
+# Show all installable versions
+asdf list-all actionlint
+
+# Install specific version
+asdf install actionlint latest
+
+# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
+asdf global actionlint latest
+```
+
+## Build from source
+
+Recent [Go][] toolchain is necessary to build actionlint from source. Use Go 1.16 or later.
+
+```sh
+# Install the latest stable version
+go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest
+
+# Install the head of main branch
+go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint
+```

+Usage
+=====
+
+This document describes how to use [actionlint](..).
+
+## `actionlint` command
+
+With no argument, actionlint finds all workflow files in the current repository and checks them.
+
+```sh
+actionlint
+```
+
+When paths to YAML workflow files are given as arguments, actionlint checks them.
+
+```sh
+actionlint path/to/workflow1.yaml path/to/workflow2.yaml
+```
+
+When `-` argument is given, actionlint reads inputs from stdin and checks it as workflow source.
+
+```sh
+cat path/to/workflow.yaml | actionlint -
+```
+
+To know all flags and options, see an output of `actionlint -h` or [the online command manual][cmd-manual].
+
+### Ignore some errors
+
+To ignore some errors, `-ignore` option offers to filter errors by messages using regular expression. The option is repeatable.
+The regular expression syntax is the same as [RE2][re2].
+
+```sh
+actionlint -ignore 'label ".+" is unknown' -ignore '".+" is potentially untrusted'
+```
+
+`-shellcheck` and `-pyflakes` specifies file paths of executables. Setting empty string to them disables `shellcheck` and
+`pyflakes` rules. As a bonus, disabling them makes actionlint much faster Since these external linter integrations spawn many
+processes.
+
+```sh
+actionlint -shellcheck= -pyflakes=
+```
+
+<a name="format"></a>
+### Format error messages
+
+`-format` option can flexibly format error messages with [Go template syntax][go-template].
+
+Before explaining the formatting details, let's see some examples.
+
+#### Example: Serialized into JSON
+
+```sh
+actionlint -format '{{json .}}'
+```
+
+Output:
+
+```
+[{"message":"unexpected key \"branch\" for ...
+```
+
+#### Example: Markdown
+
+````sh
+actionlint -format '{{range $err := .}}### Error at line {{$err.Line}}, col {{$err.Column}} of `{{$err.Filepath}}`\n\n{{$err.Message}}\n\n```\n{{$err.Snippet}}\n```\n\n{{end}}'
+````
+
+Output:
+
+````markdown
+### Error at line 21, col 20 of `test.yaml`
+
+property "platform" is not defined in object type {os: string}
+
+```
+          key: ${{ matrix.platform }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
+                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+```
+````
+
+#### Example: Serialized in [JSON Lines][jsonl]
+
+```sh
+actionlint -format '{{range $err := .}}{{json $err}}{{end}}'
+```
+
+Output:
+
+```
+{"message":"unexpected key \"branch\" for ...
+{"message":"character '\\' is invalid for branch ...
+{"message":"label \"linux-latest\" is unknown. ...
+```
+
+#### Example: [Error annotation][ga-annotate-error] on GitHub Actions
+
+````sh
+actionlint -format '{{range $err := .}}::error file={{$err.Filepath}},line={{$err.Line}},col={{$err.Column}}::{{$err.Message}}%0A```%0A{{replace $err.Snippet "\\n" "%0A"}}%0A```\n{{end}}' -ignore 'SC2016:'
+````
+
+Output:
+
+<img src="https://github.com/rhysd/ss/blob/master/actionlint/ga-annotate.png?raw=true" alt="annotations on GitHub Actions" width="731" height="522"/>
+
+To include newlines in the annotation body, it prints `%0A`. (ref [actions/toolkit#193](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues/193)).
+And it suppresses `SC2016` shellcheck rule error since it complains about the template argument.
+
+Basically it is more recommended to use [Problem Matchers](#problem-matchers) or reviewdog as explained in
+['Tools integration' section](#tools-integ) below.
+
+#### Example: [SARIF format][sarif]
+
+[The Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF)][sarif] is a standardized format for the results of static analysis tools.
+
+Since this practical format is much more complex than the above examples, the template is not written here. Please read
+[the template file in test data](../testdata/format/sarif_template.txt).
+
+Outputs are also too large to be written here. Please read [the output example in test data](../testdata/format/test.sarif).
+
+#### Formatting syntax
+
+In [Go template syntax][go-template], `.` within `{{ }}` means the target object. Here, the target object is a sequence of error
+objects.
+
+The sequence can be traversed with `range` action, which is like `for ... = range ... {}` in Go.
+
+```
+{{range $err := .}} this part iterates error objects with the iteration variable $err {{end}}
+```
+
+The error object has the following fields.
+
+| Field                | Description                                           | Example                                                          |
+|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
+| `{{$err.Message}}`   | Body of error message                                 | `property "platform" is not defined in object type {os: string}` |
+| `{{$err.Snippet}}`   | Code snippet to indicate error position               | `          node_version: 16.x\n          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~`          |
+| `{{$err.Kind}}`      | Name of rule the error belongs to                     | `expression`                                                     |
+| `{{$err.Filepath}}`  | Canonical relative file path of the error position    | `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`                                      |
+| `{{$err.Line}}`      | Line number of the error position (1-based)           | `9`                                                              |
+| `{{$err.Column}}`    | Column number of the error's start position (1-based) | `11`                                                             |
+| `{{$err.EndColumn}}` | Column number of the error's end position (1-based)   | `23`                                                             |
+
+Functions called in `{{ }}` placeholder are template actions. There are many actions defined by Go standard library. In addition,
+there are a few custom actions defined by actionlint. Most useful action would be `json` as we already used it in the above JSON
+example. List of all custom actions are as follows:
+
+| Action           | Description                                                                      | Example usage                             |
+|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
+| `json x`         | Serialize `x` as JSON string followed by newline character                       | `{{json $err}}`                           |
+| `replace x y z`  | Replace string `y` with `z` in `x`                                               | `{{replace $err.Filepath "\\" "/"}}`      |
+| `toPascalCase x` | Convert `x` into PascalCase (e.g. 'foo-bar' to 'FooBar')                         | `{{toPascalCase $err.Kind}}`              |
+| `allKinds`       | Return an array of kind objects. The kind object is explained in the below table | `{{range $ = allKinds}}{{$.Name}}{{end}}` |
+| `getVersion`     | Return the version of actionlint as string                                       | `{{getVersion}}`                          |
+
+The kind object returned from `allKinds` action has the following fields.
+
+| Field                   | Description                   | Example                                     |
+|-------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
+| `{{$kind.Name}}`        | Name of the kind              | `syntax-check`                              |
+| `{{$kind.Description}}` | Short description of the kind | `Checks for GitHub Actions workflow syntax` |
+
+For example, the following simple iteration body
+
+```
+line is {{$err.Line}}, col is {{$err.Column}}, message is {{$err.Message | printf "%q"}}
+```
+
+will produce output like below.
+
+```
+line is 21, col is 20, message is "property \"platform\" is not defined in object type {os: string}"
+```
+
+In `{{ }}` placeholder, input can be piped and action can be used to transform texts. In above example, the message is piped with
+`|` and transformed with `printf "%q"`.
+
+Note that special characters escaped with back slash like `\n` in the format string are automatically unespcaed.
+
+### Exit status
+
+`actionlint` command exits with one of the following exit statuses.
+
+| Status | Description                                             |
+|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
+| `0`    | The command ran successfully and no problem was found   |
+| `1`    | The command ran successfully and some problem was found |
+| `2`    | The command failed due to invalid command line option   |
+| `3`    | The command failed due to some fatal error              |

+## Use actionlint on GitHub Actions
+
+Preparing `actionlint` executable with the download script is recommended. See [the instruction](install.md#download-script) for
+more details. It sets an absolute file path of downloaded executable to `executable` output in order to use the executable in the
+following steps easily.
+
+Here is an example of simple workflow to run actionlint on GitHub Actions. Please ensure `shell: bash` since the default
+shell for Windows runners is `pwsh`.
+
+```yaml
+name: Lint GitHub Actions workflows
+on: [push, pull_request]
+
+jobs:
+  actionlint:
+    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+    steps:
+      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
+      - name: Download actionlint
+        id: get_actionlint
+        run: bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/actionlint/main/scripts/download-actionlint.bash)
+        shell: bash
+      - name: Check workflow files
+        run: ${{ steps.get_actionlint.outputs.executable }} -color
+        shell: bash
+```
+
+Or simply download the executable and run it in one step:
+
+```yaml
+- name: Check workflow files
+  run: |
+    bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/actionlint/main/scripts/download-actionlint.bash)
+    ./actionlint -color
+  shell: bash
+```
+
+The download script allows to specify the version of actionlint and the download directory. Try to give `--help` argument
+to the script for more usage details.
+
+If you want to enable [shellcheck integration](checks.md#check-shellcheck-integ), install `shellcheck` command. Note that
+shellcheck is [pre-installed on Ubuntu worker][preinstall-ubuntu].
+
+If you want to [annotate errors][ga-annotate-error] from actionlint on GitHub, consider to use
+[Problem Matchers](#problem-matchers).
+
+If you prefer Docker image to running a downloaded executable, using [actionlint Docker image](#docker) is another option.
+
+```yaml
+name: Lint GitHub Actions workflows
+on: [push, pull_request]
+
+jobs:
+  actionlint:
+    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+    steps:
+      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
+      - name: Check workflow files
+        uses: docker://rhysd/actionlint:latest
+        with:
+          args: -color
+```
+
+## Online playground
+
+Thanks to WebAssembly, actionlint playground is available on your browser. It never sends any data to outside of your browser.
+
+https://rhysd.github.io/actionlint/
+
+Paste your workflow content to the code editor at left pane. It automatically shows the results at right pane. When editing
+the workflow content in the code editor, the results will be updated on the fly. Clicking an error message in the results
+table moves a cursor to position of the error in the code editor.
+
+<a name="docker"></a>
+## [Docker][docker] image
+
+[Official Docker image][docker-image] is available. The image contains `actionlint` executable and all dependencies (shellcheck
+and pyflakes).
+
+Available tags are:
+
+- `actionlint:latest`: Latest stable version of actionlint. This image is recommended.
+- `actionlint:{version}`: Specific version of actionlint. (e.g. `actionlint:1.7.1`)
+
+Just run the image with `docker run`:
+
+```sh
+docker run --rm rhysd/actionlint:latest -version
+```
+
+To check all workflows in your repository, mount your repository's root directory as a volume and run actionlint in the mounted
+directory. When you are at a root directory of your repository:
+
+```sh
+docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/repo --workdir /repo rhysd/actionlint:latest -color
+```
+
+To check a file with actionlint in a Docker container, pass the file content via stdin and use `-` argument:
+
+```sh
+cat /path/to/workflow.yml | docker run --rm -i rhysd/actionlint:latest -color -
+```
+
+Or mount the workflows directory and pass the paths as arguments:
+
+```sh
+docker run --rm -v /path/to/workflows:/workflows rhysd/actionlint:latest -color /workflows/ci.yml
+```
+
+## Using actionlint from Go program
+
+Go APIs are available. See [the Go API document](api.md) for more details.
+
+
+<a name="tools-integ"></a>
+## Tools integration
+
+### reviewdog
+
+[reviewdog][] is an automated review tool for various code hosting services. It officially [supports actionlint][reviewdog-actionlint].
+You can check errors from actionlint easily with inline review comments at pull request review.
+
+The usage is easy. Run `reviewdog/action-actionlint` action in your workflow as follows.
+
+```yaml
+name: reviewdog
+on: [pull_request]
+jobs:
+  actionlint:
+    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+    steps:
+      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
+      - uses: reviewdog/action-actionlint@v1
+```
+
+<a name="problem-matchers"></a>
+### Problem Matchers
+
+[Problem Matchers][problem-matchers] is a feature to extract GitHub Actions annotations from terminal outputs of linters.
+
+Copy [actionlint-matcher.json][actionlint-matcher] to `.github/actionlint-matcher.json` in your repository.
+
+Then enable the matcher using `add-matcher` command before running `actionlint` in the step of your workflow.
+
+```yaml
+- name: Check workflow files
+  run: |
+    echo "::add-matcher::.github/actionlint-matcher.json"
+    bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/actionlint/main/scripts/download-actionlint.bash)
+    ./actionlint -color
+  shell: bash
+```
+
+When you change your workflow and the changed line causes a new error, CI will annotate the diff with the extracted error message.
+
+<img src="https://github.com/rhysd/ss/blob/master/actionlint/problem-matcher.png?raw=true" alt="annotation by Problem Matchers" width="715" height="221"/>
+
+### super-linter
+
+[super-linter][] is a Bash script for a simple combination of various linters, provided by GitHub. It has support for actionlint.
+Running super-linter in your repository automatically runs actionlint.
+
+To ignore some errors, please add `-ignore` option by using [`GITHUB_ACTIONS_COMMAND_ARGS` environment variable][super-linter-env-var].
+Please see [super-linter/super-linter#1852](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter/issues/1852) for the discussion.
+
+### pre-commit
+
+[pre-commit][] is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language Git pre-commit hooks. actionlint is available as a
+pre-commit hook to check workflow files in `.github/workflows/` directory.
+
+Add this to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in your repository:
+
+```yaml
+---
+repos:
+  - repo: https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint
+    rev: v1.7.1
+    hooks:
+      - id: actionlint
+```
+
+As alternatives to `actionlint` hook, `actionlint-docker` or `actionlint-system` hooks are available.
+
+| Hook ID | Explanation |
+|-|-|
+| `actionlint` | Automatically installs `actionlint` command in isolated `$GOPATH` directory using [Go toolchain][go-install]. |
+| `actionlint-docker` | Automatically pulls [the actionlint Docker image](#docker). |
+| `actionlint-system` | Uses system-installed `actionlint` command. The command is necessary to be [installed manually](install.md). |
+
+### VS Code
+
+[Linter extension][vsc-extension] for [VS Code][vscode] is available. The extension automatically detects `.github/workflows`
+directory, runs `actionlint` command, and reports errors in the code editor while editing workflow files.
+
+### Emacs
+
+Plugins for both [Flycheck][emacs-flycheck] and [Flymake][emacs-flymake] are available via [MELPA][emacs-melpa].
+
+Their respective repositories are [flycheck-actionlint][emacs-flycheck-extension] and [flymake-actionlint][emacs-flymake-extension].
+
+### Vim and Neovim
+
+[nvim-lint][] supports actionlint on Neovim. The plugin automatically and asynchronously runs actionlint and notifies errors
+on the fly when you edit GitHub Actions CI workflows. Please read the plugin's documentation for more details.
+
+[ALE][vim-ale] supports actionlint on Vim and Neovim. Similar to nvim-lint, The plugin automatically and asynchronously runs
+actionlint and notifies errors on the fly when you edit GitHub Actions CI workflows. Please read the plugin's documentation for
+more details.
+
+### Pulsar Edit
+
+A [Linter package][pulsar-linter] for [Pulsar Edit][pulsar] is available. The package automatically detects a `workflows`
+directory, executes the `actionlint` command on any detected GitHub Actions files within the directory, and reports returned
+information in the code editor display tab while editing workflow files.
+
+### Nova
+
+[Nova.app][nova] is a MacOS only editor and IDE. The [Actionlint for Nova][nova-extension] allows you to get inline feedback
+while editing actions.
+
+### trunk
+
+[trunk][trunk-io] is an extendable superlinter with a builtin language server and preexisting issue detection. Actionlint is
+integrated [here](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins).
+
+Once you have [initialized trunk in your repo](https://docs.trunk.io/docs/check-get-started), to enable at the latest actionlint
+version, just run:
+
+```bash
+trunk check enable actionlint
+```
+
+or if you'd like a specific version:
+
+```bash
+trunk check enable actionlint@1.7.1
+```
+
+or modify `.trunk/trunk.yaml` in your repo to contain:
+
+```yaml
+lint:
+  enabled:
+    - actionlint@1.7.1
+```
+
+Then just run:
+
+```bash
+trunk check
+```
+
+and it will check your modified files via actionlint, if applicable, and show you the results. Trunk also will detect preexisting
+issues and highlight only the newly added actionlint issues. For more information, check the [trunk docs][trunk-docs].
+
+You can also see actionlint issues inline in VS Code via the [Trunk VS Code extension][trunk-vscode].
