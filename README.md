# Browser

[![CI](https://github.com/bniladridas/browser/workflows/Flutter%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bniladridas/browser/actions)

A simple Flutter desktop application that provides a URL launcher interface.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bniladridas/browser.git
cd browser
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Usage

Launch the application and enter a URL in the text field at the top. Press Enter to open the URL in your system's default web browser.

The app automatically prepends `https://` if the URL does not start with `http://` or `https://`.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```dart
// Example usage in code
void _loadUrl(String url) async {
  if (!url.startsWith('http://') && !url.startsWith('https://')) {
    url = 'https://$url';
  }
  final uri = Uri.parse(url);
  if (await canLaunchUrl(uri)) {
    await launchUrl(uri);
  }
}
```
