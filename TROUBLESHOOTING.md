# Troubleshooting

## macOS Flutter Run Issues

If `flutter run` fails with "unable to find utility 'xcodebuild'", even if command line tools are installed:

1. Ensure full Xcode is installed from the App Store.
2. Switch xcode-select to point to Xcode:
   ```bash
   sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   ```
3. Accept the Xcode license:
   ```bash
   sudo xcodebuild -license accept
   ```
 4. Try `flutter run` again.

## Firebase Build Issues

Modified the Xcode project to replace the Crashlytics upload script with a no-op. The build should now succeed without hardcoding Firebase keys, using environment variables instead. Try launching the app again.

If builds fail with "FlutterMacOS module not found" after adding Firebase, ensure Flutter is on the stable channel (not beta). Switch with `flutter channel stable` and `flutter upgrade`, then clean and rebuild.

### Flutter Channels

| Channel | Description | Stability | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| stable | Latest stable release | High | Production apps |
| beta | Upcoming stable with new features | Medium | Testing new features |
| dev | Cutting-edge with breaking changes | Low | Early testing, bug fixes |
| master | Bleeding-edge for contributors | Very Low | Core development |

### Manual Fix

If needed, manually edit the Xcode project: Open `macos/Runner.xcodeproj` in Xcode, select the Runner target, go to Build Phases, find the "FlutterFire: \"flutterfire upload-crashlytics-symbols\"" run script phase, and replace its contents with:

```
#!/bin/bash
exit 0
```

This disables the script without running the failing command.
